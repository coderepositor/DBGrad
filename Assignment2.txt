Task 8: Create a Private Counter for Multiple Instances
Write a closure-based function that creates multiple instances of a private counter. Each instance should have its own count, independent of the others. For example:

const counter1 = createInstanceCounter();
const counter2 = createInstanceCounter();

console.log(counter1()); // Output: 1
console.log(counter1()); // Output: 2
console.log(counter2()); // Output: 1
console.log(counter2()); // Output: 2

Task 9: Create a Promise-Based Calculator
